Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take three images, a content image, a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter), and the input image you want to style -- and blend them together such that the input image is transformed to look like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style image.
Here's a deeper dive into how NST works:

Feature Extraction: At the heart of NST lies a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), often VGG19 or a similar architecture. These networks are trained on large datasets for tasks like image classification. However, they also capture intricate details of images at different levels of abstraction. Specifically, the earlier layers tend to capture low-level features like edges and textures, while deeper layers capture high-level features like objects and structures.
Content and Style Representations: When we pass an image through the network, we obtain feature maps at various layers. For NST, we extract feature maps from both the content image and the style image. These feature maps represent the content and style information of the respective images. Content features capture the unique visual content of the content image, while style features capture the artistic elements and textures present in the style image.
Loss Functions: The objective of NST is to generate an image that preserves the content of the content image while adopting the style of the style image. To achieve this, NST uses two types of loss functions:
Content Loss: This loss measures the difference between the feature maps of the generated image and the content image. By minimizing the content loss, we ensure that the generated image maintains the content of the content image.
Style Loss: This loss measures the difference in style between the feature maps of the generated image and the style image. It is calculated based on the statistical properties of the feature maps, such as correlations between different features. Minimizing the style loss enables the generated image to adopt the artistic style of the style image.
Optimization Process: With the content and style losses defined, we use an optimization algorithm, typically gradient descent, to iteratively update the pixel values of the generated image. The goal is to minimize both the content and style losses simultaneously. As the optimization progresses, the generated image gradually transforms to strike a balance between preserving content and adopting style.
Intermediate Results: During the optimization process, it's common to visualize intermediate results to monitor the style transfer. By observing how the generated image evolves over iterations, we can adjust parameters or experiment with different styles to achieve the desired artistic effect.
Final Artwork: Once the optimization converges or reaches a stopping criterion, we obtain the final stylized image. This image seamlessly blends the content of the content image with the style of the style image, creating a unique and visually captivating composition.
In summary, NST showcases the power of deep neural networks to understand and manipulate visual content in a creative manner. It has gained popularity in digital art, photography, and design communities, offering endless possibilities for generating captivating and personalized artworks.
